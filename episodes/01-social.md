All new instructors contribute to one or more
of the Carpentry lessons after going through the instructor training
course. 

We want each group of Maintainers to work as a team. This means they will need to coordinate some strategy for who does what and on what timeframe. 

Avoiding demotivating language
Example problems of appropriate difficulty
Teach most useful first
Avoid delving in the weeds
Our motivation and demotivation episode covers much of this

What are the traits we want Maintainers to show?
Patience with contributors who make mistakes
Politeness, even if a contribution is not wanted
Quick responsiveness
Initiative
Appropriate caution about not breaking things
Deep familiarity with their lesson (and how it fits in with the overall workshop structure)

What to do with:
Really old PRs (> 6 months)
PRs introducing new exercises (examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
PRs with bad formatting (examples: 1, 
PRs that are an improvement but not a full solution (e.g. this one)
PRs that conflict with other PRs (examples: 1,
Old PRs with merge conflicts (examples: 1, 
PRs where Maintainer made suggestions but no one has implemented them (examples: 1, 2, 3
PRs that introduce things beyond the level of the lesson (examples: 1
PRs with a lot of debate (examples: 1, 2
Comments from community members that might come across negatively (examples: 1
